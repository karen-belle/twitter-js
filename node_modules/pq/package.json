  "readme": "`pq` is a lightweight priority job queue in node.js. It's meant to be easy to read and use. Once you start a worker, it runs for as long as the process runs. Jobs are queued and run asynchronously, and can have optional priorities, which are arbitrary integers. Workers can run one (by default) or many jobs at the same time (although node.js by itself can only run on one thread, so it's more for I/O than true concurrency). Workers can optionally return results back to the caller, even if they're in separate processes.\n\nDependencies\n============\n\n- [redis](https://github.com/mranney/node_redis) >= 0.8.2\n- [async](https://github.com/caolan/async) >= 0.1.22\n\nInstallation\n============\n\n`npm install pq` or add `pq` to your package.json's dependencies.\n\nUsage\n=====\n\nHere's a demo of using `pq` to create a simple addition calculator.\n\nTo create a worker:\n\n```javascript\npq.worker(\"add\", function(args, cb){\n\tvar num1 = args.num1;\n\tvar num2 = args.num2;\n\tcb(null, num1 + num2);\n});\n```\n\nTo create a normal-priority job that you don't need a callback to:\n\n```javascript\npq.job(\"add\", {\n\tnum1: 42,\n\tnum2: 7\n});\n```\n\nTo create a normal-priority job and get the result:\n\n```javascript\npq.job(\"add\", {\n\tnum1: 42,\n\tnum2: 7\n}, function(err, result, request){\n\tconsole.log(\"Result should be 49: \" + result);\n});\n```\n\nTo create a job with a different priority:\n\n```javascript\npq.job(\"add\", {\n\tnum1: 42,\n\tnum2: 7\n}, {\n\tpriority: pq.job.PRIORITY.HIGH\n});\n```\n\nTo create a job with a different priority and get the result:\n\n```javascript\npq.job(\"add\", {\n\tnum1: 42,\n\tnum2: 7\n}, {\n\tpriority: pq.job.PRIORITY.HIGH\n}, function(err, result, request){\n\tconsole.log(\"Result should be 49: \" + result);\n});\n```\n\nLicense\n=======\n\n**tl;dr: MIT License, do what you want, just attribute for it**\n\nCopyright (c) 2012 Steve Streza.\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal in the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
